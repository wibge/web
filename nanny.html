We are a family of five (plus a golden retriever) living in the lower elevation area of Incline Village. We are looking for a live-in nanny for Spring, move-in dates would be mid December-mid January, but it would be possible to start working part time as a nanny immediately, and we would like (paid) babysitting once or twice as part of the interview. 

My husband and I both work from home as computer programmers. We both enjoyed having roommates, and even had roommates until our second kid was almost 1. So I think we’re flexible and easy to live with, and we like having more people around. You are welcome to eat dinner with us and be part of the family as much as you like, you are also welcome to have your own space.

My kids are almost 2, 6, and 8. They’re outgoing and curious kids. The older two are in school five days a week, so we’d mostly need toddler care and afterschool care. I think it is likely that the older two will be home for two week quarantines a few times, and we are also looking for flexibility in those situations.

Our schedule is a bit flexible because we work from home, but roughly we’d want 45 hours of care a week from 8:30-5:30. The toddler is on a waitlist for several preschool programs. So it’s possible it’d be fewer hours later, but we are flexible on that and can accomodate your desired schedule. We are offering $20 an hour, paid legally. Room, board, and utilities are included. 

The room is really nice. It’s the master bedroom and has a large closet and large private bathroom. It’s furnished but we can move things around too. 

We have had a live-in nanny since May. She is leaving to go back to college, you can definitely chat with her to learn about us and the kids. 

We are looking for someone we can have an open and continuing conversation with about COVID safety. Right now we are comfortable with any outdoors activity, and seeing a few friends in their houses. We are looking for someone who is okay not doing activities like going to bars, indoor dining, or indoor gyms. 

We are hoping to find someone to be very active with the kids. In the summer, our current nanny took them to ivgid beaches, Sand Harbor, the bike park, hikes in Tahoe Meadows, etc almost every day. The kids also enjoy doing crafts and projects at home. My 8 year old will constantly ask you to play D&D with him, but it’s okay if that’s not your thing. 

Here is a photo album from some of our activities this summer - https://www.icloud.com/photos/#04gVbSJeFO6TkoJQ2aeHFfo_g
There are also pictures of your room from before it was furnished. 

If you’re interested in joining our family, please send me a message telling me about yourself and your experience with kids.
